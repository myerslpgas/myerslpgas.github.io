## A brief history:

Myers L.P. Gas, Inc. was established by Steve Myers in 2001. Steve, being a farmer in Daviess Co. Indiana had the opportunity to acquire two 12,000 gallon tanks from a local factory. His initial thought was to move the tanks to his grain systems and purchase propane by the transport load for drying crops. After some consideration, he decided to locate the storage tanks in one location and start the locally owned propane company Myers L.P. Gas, Inc., with Steve Myers Farms being the first customer.

Since then, Myers L.P. Gas, Inc. has grown into a 3,500 customer base energy company with three locations (two in Indiana and one in Illinois). Myers L.P. Gas, Inc. has a fleet of six delivery trucks, one boom truck, and multiple service trucks to serve its customers quickly and efficiently.

"Our goal at Myers L.P. Gas, Inc. is to provide propane to our customers safely and economically, with service that is second to none."
